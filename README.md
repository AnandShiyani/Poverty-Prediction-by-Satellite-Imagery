# Poverty Prediction by Combination of Satellite Imagery and Mechine Learning
*Is it feasible for you to estimate the standard of living or energy consumption of a site based night-time satellite imagery?This means whether we can do the satellite imagery processing for socioeconomic analysis?*

*Let's find it out in this project.*

Key Steps
-------
1. Download satellite night lights images from NOAA
2. Download DHS data for Rwanda
3. Test whether night lights data can predict wealth, as observed in DHS
4. Download daytime satellite imagery from Google Maps
5. Test whether basic features of daytime imagery can predict wealth
6. Extract features from daytime imagery using deep learning libraries
7. Replicate final model and results of Jean et al (2016)
8. Construct maps showing the predicted distribution of wealth in Rwanda

A night time satellite imagery:
